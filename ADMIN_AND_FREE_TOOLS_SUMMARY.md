## ⚠️ **NEEDS TO BE DONE**

### 1. **Run Database Migration** (CRITICAL)

The admin dashboard and free tools won't work until you run this:

**Steps:**

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Open: `supabase/migrations/20250116000002_free_tool_usage.sql`
3. Copy the entire file
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click "Run"

### 2. **Update Remaining Free Tools** (Recommended)

I've fully updated Claude Prompt Creator, but you still need to update:

- **Cursor Prompt Creator** (`components/CursorPromptCreator.tsx`)
- **Prompt Optimizer** (`components/PromptOptimizer.tsx`)

These need the same changes I made to Claude Creator.

### 3. **Add Pending Prompt Handler** (Nice to Have)

When users sign up after using a free tool, automatically save their generated prompt.
