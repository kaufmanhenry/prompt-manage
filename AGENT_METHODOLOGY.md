**Key Files to Work With**:
- `components/ui/` - UI component library
- `app/globals.css` - Global styles
- `components/theme-provider.tsx` - Theme management
- Design system components

## Collaboration Workflow

### 1. **Feature Development Process**

```
1. Project Manager Agent defines feature requirements
2. Database Agent creates/updates schema if needed
3. Backend Agent implements API endpoints
4. Frontend Agent builds UI components
5. Authentication Agent ensures proper security
6. Testing Agent validates functionality
7. UI/UX Agent polishes the experience
8. Project Manager Agent reviews and approves
```

### 2. **Communication Protocol**

Each agent should:
- **Document Changes**: Add comments explaining complex logic
- **Update Related Files**: Ensure consistency across the codebase
- **Notify Dependencies**: Alert other agents when their work affects others
- **Follow Naming Conventions**: Use consistent patterns across the project
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement proper error handling and user feedback

### 3. **Code Review Process**

```
1. Agent completes feature implementation
2. Agent runs self-review (tests, linting, type checking)
3. Agent documents changes and dependencies
4. Project Manager Agent reviews for MVP alignment
5. Related agents review for integration issues
6. Testing Agent validates functionality
7. Feature is approved and merged
```
