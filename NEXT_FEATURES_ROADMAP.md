# Next Features Roadmap - Teams & High-Volume Users

**Focus:** Simple, high-impact features that unlock value for teams and high-volume users

**Goal:** Ship features that directly support CMS for prompts, team collaboration, and scaling to hundreds/thousands of prompts per user.

---

## üéØ Top Priority Features (Ship First)

### 1. **Bulk Import/Export** ‚≠ê HIGHEST VALUE

**Why:** Essential for high-volume users managing hundreds of prompts. Critical for teams migrating from spreadsheets/other tools.

**What to Build:**

- **Import:** CSV/JSON file upload ‚Üí Parse ‚Üí Create prompts in bulk
- **Export:** Select prompts ‚Üí Download as CSV/JSON with all metadata
- **Validation:** Preview before import, error handling, progress tracking
- **Team Support:** Import to shared team library (if Teams feature enabled)

**Implementation:**

- New page: `/dashboard/import-export`
- API: `POST /api/prompts/bulk-import`, `POST /api/prompts/bulk-export`
- UI: Drag-and-drop upload, progress bar, error summary

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 weeks
**Impact:** Unlocks migration path for enterprise customers, reduces friction for power users

---

### 2. **Token Tracking Backend Integration** üî• CRITICAL

**Why:** Your UI components exist but aren't connected. This is THE differentiator for high-volume users who need cost visibility.

**What's Already Built:**

- ‚úÖ Token tracking UI components (`TokenUsageDisplay`, `TokenPreview`, `BudgetWarning`)
- ‚úÖ Database migrations exist
- ‚úÖ Pricing calculations documented

**What's Missing:**

- ‚ùå Backend API endpoints (`/api/usage/track`, `/api/usage/stats`)
- ‚ùå Integration into `/api/prompt/run` endpoint
- ‚ùå Cost preview in Prompt Lab
- ‚ùå Usage dashboard

**Implementation:**

- Connect existing components to backend
- Add token tracking to prompt execution flow
- Build simple usage stats API
- Add cost preview to prompt editor

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 weeks
**Impact:** Core value prop - users can see and control costs (essential for enterprise)

---

### 3. **Advanced Search & Filtering** üìä HIGH VALUE

**Why:** When users have 100+ prompts, basic search isn't enough. Need filters by tags, model, date, collections, etc.

**What to Build:**

- **Filters:** Tags, model, collection, date range, public/private, created/updated
- **Saved Searches:** Save common filter combinations
- **Sort Options:** Alphabetical, date, usage count, cost
- **Quick Filters:** "My favorites", "Recent", "Untagged", "High cost"

**Implementation:**

- Enhance existing search in dashboard
- Add filter sidebar/bar
- URL params for shareable filtered views
- Client-side filtering for speed

**Time Estimate:** 1 week
**Impact:** Dramatically improves usability for power users with large libraries

---

## üöÄ Second Priority Features (After Core)

### 4. **Public API Access** üîå MEDIUM VALUE

**Why:** High-volume users need to automate prompt management (CI/CD, integrations, scripts).

**What to Build:**

- **API Keys:** Generate/manage API keys in settings
- **REST API:** Full CRUD for prompts, collections
  - `GET /api/v1/prompts` - List with filters
  - `POST /api/v1/prompts` - Create
  - `GET /api/v1/prompts/:id` - Get one
  - `PUT /api/v1/prompts/:id` - Update
  - `DELETE /api/v1/prompts/:id` - Delete
  - `POST /api/v1/prompts/:id/run` - Execute
- **Rate Limiting:** Per API key
- **Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger docs

**Implementation:**

- New API route structure: `/app/api/v1/`
- API key middleware for auth
- Rate limiting per key
- Auto-generated docs

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 weeks
**Impact:** Enables integrations and automation (valuable for enterprise)

---

### 5. **Team Collaboration Basics** üë• MEDIUM VALUE

**Why:** Core value prop for "teams" - but start simple, ship fast.

**What to Build (MVP):**

- **Shared Prompts:** Mark prompts as "team accessible" (no permissions yet)
- **Team Dashboard:** View team's shared prompts
- **Basic Sharing:** Invite via email ‚Üí they see shared prompts
- **Team Collections:** Collections visible to team

**Skip for Now:**

- ‚ùå Complex permissions (viewer/editor/admin)
- ‚ùå Fine-grained access control
- ‚ùå Team billing (use existing user billing)

**Implementation:**

- Leverage existing `teams` table structure
- Simple "team_id" on prompts
- Team switcher component (already exists)
- Team dashboard page

**Time Estimate:** 2 weeks
**Impact:** Unlocks team value prop without complexity

---

### 6. **Usage Analytics Dashboard** üìà MEDIUM VALUE

**Why:** High-volume users need visibility into what they're using most, costs, trends.

**What to Build:**

- **Simple Dashboard:**
  - Total prompts run this month
  - Total cost (if token tracking enabled)
  - Most-used prompts (top 10)
  - Cost by model
  - Usage over time (simple line chart)
- **Export:** Download usage report as CSV

**Implementation:**

- New page: `/dashboard/analytics`
- Query existing `prompt_run_history` table
- Simple charts with Recharts (already in dependencies)
- Aggregate by day/week/month

**Time Estimate:** 1 week
**Impact:** Provides value for users who want to optimize usage

---

## üé® Nice-to-Have (Lower Priority)

### 7. **Prompt Templates Library**

- Pre-built templates for common use cases
- Categorized (marketing, coding, content, etc.)
- One-click "Use Template"

### 8. **Bulk Operations in UI**

- Select multiple prompts ‚Üí Bulk tag, bulk move to collection, bulk delete
- Already have multi-select in collections, extend to main dashboard

### 9. **Prompt Duplication Detection**

- When creating, suggest similar prompts
- Warn if creating duplicate
- Option to merge/fork instead

---

## üìã Recommended Implementation Order

```
Week 1-2:   Bulk Import/Export (highest value, unblocks enterprise)
Week 3-4:   Token Tracking Backend (differentiator, core value)
Week 5:     Advanced Search/Filtering (quick win, high UX impact)
Week 6-8:   Public API OR Team Basics (choose based on user demand)
Week 9:     Usage Analytics Dashboard (builds on token tracking)
```

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

**Bulk Import/Export:**

- % of users with 50+ prompts who use import/export
- Average prompts imported per session
- Reduction in time to migrate from other tools

**Token Tracking:**

- % of paid users who view cost dashboard
- % who set budget limits
- Cost optimization (avg cost reduction after using features)

**Advanced Search:**

- % of users with 20+ prompts who use filters
- Most common filter combinations
- Reduction in time to find prompts

---

## üí° Key Principles

1. **Ship Simple First:** Don't over-engineer. Get value to users quickly.
2. **Iterate Based on Usage:** Build advanced features only if basic ones are used.
3. **Focus on Core Value:** CMS for prompts = organization, search, bulk management.
4. **Teams = Collaboration:** Start with simple sharing, add permissions later.
5. **High-Volume = Automation:** Import/export and API unlock automation use cases.

---

## üö´ What NOT to Build (For Now)

- ‚ùå **Autonomous Workflows:** Too complex, not core CMS value
- ‚ùå **Data Connectors:** Out of scope, focus on prompts first
- ‚ùå **Complex Team Permissions:** Start simple, add later
- ‚ùå **AI Agent System:** Nice-to-have, not core CMS
- ‚ùå **Advanced Reporting:** Basic analytics first

---

## üìù Notes

- Token tracking components exist but aren't wired up - this is quick win
- Collections already support multi-select - extend this pattern
- Search exists but basic - enhance it incrementally
- Teams infrastructure exists - use it simply first

**Bottom Line:** Focus on making prompt management faster and easier for users with many prompts. Bulk operations, better search, and cost visibility are the highest-value features.
