          notification or complaint related to copyright infringement, Prompt Manage may remove the
          content identified as being infringing, as long as we receive all of the required
          information for a DMCA request, and we are able to verify the validity of the request. In
          addition, Prompt Manage may terminate the account of the user that appears to be the
          infringer.

        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          If the recipient of a DMCA Takedown (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;) believes that the Notice is
          erroneous or false, and/or that allegedly infringing material has been wrongly removed in
          accordance with the procedures outlined above, the recipient is permitted to submit a
          counter-notification pursuant to Section 512(g)(2)&(3) of the DMCA. A counter-notification
          is the proper method for the recipient to dispute the removal or disabling of material
          pursuant to a Notice. The information that a recipient provides in a counter-notification
          must be accurate and truthful, and the recipient will be liable for any misrepresentations
          which may cause any claims to be brought against Prompt Manage relating to the actions
          taken in response to the counter-notification. This counter-notification will be forwarded
          to the original party that submitted the DMCA claim. If we have not received notice
          (within 14 days) that the original claimant has filed an action seeking a court order to
          restrain the recipient from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on
          Prompt Manage&rsquo;s system or network, we will re-instate the content.
