                Prompt Manage is a platform for organizing, sharing, and managing AI prompts. This website
                qualifies as a "Service Provider" within the meaning of 17 U.S. Code ยง 512 of
                the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). As a service provider, Prompt Manage
                is entitled to certain protections from claims of copyright infringement under the
                DMCA, commonly referred to as the "safe harbor" provisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                We respect the intellectual property of others and ask all users to do the same. 
                Accordingly, we observe and comply with the DMCA, and have adopted the following 
                Copyright Infringement Notice and Takedown Policy relating to claims of copyright 
                infringement by our users.
              </p>
              <p>
                The DMCA provides a process for copyright owners to notify service providers of 
                alleged copyright infringement. It also provides a process for users to submit 
                counter-notifications if they believe their content was wrongly removed.

                Under Section 512 of the DMCA, online service providers are protected from monetary 
                liability for copyright infringement if they meet certain conditions, including:

              <ul className="ml-6 space-y-2 list-disc">
                <li>Designating an agent to receive copyright infringement notices</li>
                <li>Implementing a notice-and-takedown system</li>
                <li>Not having actual knowledge of infringing activity</li>
                <li>Acting expeditiously to remove infringing content when notified</li>
