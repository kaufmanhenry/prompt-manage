## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why separate Free and Teams features?
**A:** To incentivize upgrades while providing value at all tiers. Free users get basic visibility, paid users get actionable insights.

### Q: How accurate are token estimates?
**A:** ~90% accurate using the 4-chars-per-token heuristic. We can improve this to 95%+ using OpenAI's tiktoken library.

### Q: What happens when budget is exceeded?
**A:** Users receive alerts and can choose to either increase their budget or wait until next billing cycle. We don't automatically block execution (to avoid poor UX).

### Q: How do we handle model pricing changes?
**A:** Pricing is configured in `lib/pricing.ts` and can be updated without code changes. We'll implement a pricing history table for accuracy.

### Q: Can users export their data?
**A:** Yes! Teams can export CSV, Enterprise gets CSV + PDF + API access.
