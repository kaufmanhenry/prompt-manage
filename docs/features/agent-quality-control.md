## üìù How Quality Control Works

### During Generation

1. **System Prompt Enhancement**: Quality instructions added to AI prompt
   ```
   BRAND VOICE: Professional yet approachable, innovative
   
   KEY PHRASES TO INCLUDE: proven strategies, data-backed results
   
   FORBIDDEN PHRASES (never use): click here, buy now, guaranteed
   
   STYLE GUIDE:
   - Use active voice
   - Keep paragraphs under 4 sentences
   - Include examples
   ```

2. **Required Elements Enforced**: Specific structure requirements included in prompt

3. **Examples Provided**: Good/bad examples shown to guide generation

### After Generation

1. **Automated Checks**:
   - ‚úÖ Scan for forbidden phrases
   - ‚úÖ Verify word count within range
   - ‚úÖ Calculate quality score
   - ‚úÖ Log any quality issues

2. **Quality Scoring**:
   - No issues: 0.8 score
   - With issues: 0.6 score
   - Issues logged in `strategy_context`

3. **Review Queue**:
   - If `review_required = true`: Content goes to review
   - If `quality_score < min_quality_score`: Flagged for review
   - Auto-approve if passes all checks

## üîç Quality Checks Performed

### Automated Checks

1. **Forbidden Phrase Detection**
   - Scans content for banned phrases
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Logs violations

2. **Word Count Validation**
   - Checks against min/max limits
   - Flags if outside range
   - Adjusts quality score

3. **Quality Score Calculation**
   - Base score: 0.8
   - Reduced if issues found
   - Compared against threshold

### Manual Review Process

When `review_required = true` or quality score too low:

1. Content saved with status: `pending`
2. Admin reviews in dashboard
3. Can approve, reject, or request revision
4. Revision notes stored for agent learning

---

## üìä Review Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Awaiting review |
| `approved` | Passed review, published |
| `rejected` | Did not meet standards |
| `needs_revision` | Requires changes |
| `auto_approved` | Passed all automated checks |

---

## üéì Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple, Iterate
```
Week 1: Just forbidden phrases
Week 2: Add key phrases
Week 3: Add style guide
Week 4: Add full quality standards
```

### 2. Use Specific, Clear Guidelines
‚ùå Bad: "Write good content"
‚úÖ Good: "Include 1 statistic per section. Bold key takeaways. 2-4 sentences per paragraph."

### 3. Provide Examples
- Show good vs. bad examples
- Include actual headlines, intros
- Demonstrate desired style

### 4. Test and Refine
1. Generate test content
2. Review quality
3. Adjust guidelines
4. Test again

### 5. Balance Control vs. Creativity
- Too strict = robotic content
- Too loose = inconsistent quality
- Find your sweet spot

---

## üîß Advanced Configurations

### Multi-Brand Setup
Different brands, different voices:

```javascript
// Brand A: Professional
{
  brand_voice: "Professional, data-driven, authoritative",
  forbidden_phrases: ["cheap", "amazing", "revolutionary"]
}

// Brand B: Casual
{
  brand_voice: "Casual, friendly, conversational",
  forbidden_phrases: ["leverage", "synergy", "paradigm"]
}
```

### A/B Testing Quality Standards
Create two agents with different standards:

```javascript
// Agent A: Strict
{ min_quality_score: 0.9, review_required: true }

// Agent B: Balanced
{ min_quality_score: 0.75, review_required: false }

// Compare: quality vs. volume
```

### Progressive Quality Levels

```javascript
// Tier 1: Basic (social media)
{ min_quality_score: 0.70, simple_style_guide }

// Tier 2: Standard (blog posts)
{ min_quality_score: 0.80, detailed_style_guide }

// Tier 3: Premium (whitepapers)
{ min_quality_score: 0.90, comprehensive_guidelines, review_required: true }
```
