# Derivative Prompts Feature

This feature allows users to copy public prompts into their personal collection while maintaining a link to the original prompt.

## Overview

When a user finds a useful public prompt, they can now copy it to their personal collection with a single click. The copied prompt maintains a reference to the original, showing that it's a derivative work.

## Features

### ðŸ”— Copy to Personal Collection

- **One-click copying**: Users can copy any public prompt to their personal collection
- **Automatic naming**: Copied prompts get "(Copy)" appended to the name
- **Private by default**: All copied prompts are private and can be customized
- **Duplicate prevention**: Users can only copy a prompt once

### ðŸ“Š Derivative Tracking

- **Parent-child relationship**: Each copied prompt links back to the original
- **Visual indicators**: Clear indication when a prompt is a derivative
- **Usage statistics**: Public prompts show how many times they've been copied

### ðŸŽ¨ User Interface

- **Copy button**: Prominent "Copy to My Prompts" button on public prompt pages
- **Derivative badges**: Visual indicators in the dashboard for derivative prompts
- **Statistics display**: Shows derivative count on public prompt pages

## Database Schema

### New Fields

- `parent_prompt_id`: UUID reference to the original prompt (nullable)
- Indexes for efficient querying of derivative relationships

### New Functions

- `copy_public_prompt()`: Copies a public prompt to a user's collection
- `get_derivative_prompts()`: Retrieves all derivatives of a given prompt

## API Endpoints
