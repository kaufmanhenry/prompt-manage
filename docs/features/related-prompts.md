# Related Prompts Feature

## Overview

The Related Prompts feature enhances the public prompt viewing experience by intelligently suggesting similar prompts to users. This collaborative feature helps users discover relevant content and increases engagement across the platform.

## Features

### 1. Multi-Strategy Related Content Discovery

The feature uses a sophisticated algorithm with multiple strategies to find related prompts:

- **Tag-based Matching**: Finds prompts with similar tags (highest priority)
- **Model-based Matching**: Finds prompts designed for the same AI model
- **Popular Prompts**: Shows trending prompts as a fallback

### 2. Tabbed Interface

Users can explore different types of related content through an intuitive tabbed interface:

- **Tags Tab**: Shows prompts with similar tags
- **Model Tab**: Shows prompts for the same AI model
- **Popular Tab**: Shows trending prompts

### 3. Smart Fallback System

The algorithm intelligently falls back to different strategies:

1. First tries to find prompts with exact tag matches
2. Falls back to model + tag overlap
3. Falls back to same model only
4. Finally shows popular prompts

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

```
components/
└── RelatedPrompts.tsx          # Main component
    ├── PromptCard              # Individual prompt display
    ├── LoadingSkeleton         # Loading state
    ├── EmptyState              # Empty state handling
    └── Tabs                    # Tabbed interface
```

### Database Queries

The feature uses optimized Supabase queries:

```typescript
// Tag-based matching
.overlaps('tags', currentPrompt.tags)

// Model-based matching
.eq('model', currentPrompt.model)

// Popular prompts
.order('view_count', { ascending: false })
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **Parallel Queries**: All related prompt types are fetched simultaneously
- **Caching**: Results are cached in component state
- **Lazy Loading**: Component only renders when needed
- **Efficient Filtering**: Uses database-level filtering to minimize data transfer

## User Experience

### Visual Design

- **Clean Interface**: Minimal, focused design that doesn't distract from main content
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle hover states for better interactivity
- **Responsive Layout**: Works well on all screen sizes
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading animations

### Interaction Patterns

- **Quick Copy**: One-click copy functionality for each related prompt
- **Easy Navigation**: Direct links to related prompt pages
- **Tab Switching**: Seamless switching between different related content types
- **Browse All**: Link to explore all public prompts

## Benefits

### For Users

1. **Discovery**: Find relevant prompts they might not have discovered otherwise
2. **Efficiency**: Quickly access similar content without manual searching
3. **Learning**: Understand different approaches to similar tasks
4. **Engagement**: Spend more time exploring the platform

### For Platform

1. **Increased Engagement**: Users spend more time on the platform
2. **Better Content Discovery**: Prompts get more exposure
3. **Improved User Retention**: Better user experience leads to higher retention
4. **Data Insights**: Better understanding of content relationships

## Technical Architecture

### Component Integration

The RelatedPrompts component is integrated into the public prompt page:

```typescript
// app/p/[slug]/PublicPromptPageClient.tsx
import { RelatedPrompts } from '@/components/RelatedPrompts'

// In the sidebar
<RelatedPrompts currentPrompt={prompt} maxResults={4} />
```

### State Management

- Uses React hooks for local state management
- No external state management required
- Efficient re-rendering with proper dependency arrays

### Error Handling

- Graceful error handling with fallback states
- Component doesn't break if related prompts can't be loaded
- User-friendly error messages

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Content Similarity**: Add semantic similarity based on prompt content
2. **User Behavior**: Consider user interaction patterns
3. **Collaborative Filtering**: Use collaborative filtering algorithms
4. **Personalization**: Show personalized recommendations based on user history
5. **A/B Testing**: Test different recommendation strategies

### Advanced Features

1. **Real-time Updates**: Update recommendations based on new content
2. **Machine Learning**: Implement ML-based recommendation engine
3. **Social Features**: Show prompts from followed users
4. **Trending Alerts**: Highlight trending related content

## Testing

### Test Coverage

- Component rendering and interaction tests
- Database query validation
- Error handling scenarios
- Performance testing
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Test Files

```
tests/
└── related-prompts.spec.ts     # E2E tests for the feature
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization

- Uses indexed columns for efficient queries
- Limits result sets to prevent performance issues
- Leverages database-level filtering

### Frontend Optimization

- Efficient React rendering with proper key props
- Minimal re-renders with optimized dependency arrays
- Lazy loading and conditional rendering

## Security

### Data Access

- Only shows public prompts
- Respects user privacy settings
- No sensitive data exposure

### Query Security

- Uses parameterized queries
- Validates input data
- Implements proper error boundaries

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Metrics to Track

1. **Engagement**: Click-through rates on related prompts
2. **Discovery**: Time spent exploring related content
3. **Conversion**: Users who copy or use related prompts
4. **Performance**: Query response times and component load times

### Implementation

```typescript
// Example analytics tracking
const trackRelatedPromptClick = (promptId: string, type: string) => {
  analytics.track('related_prompt_clicked', {
    promptId,
    relatedType: type,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  })
}
```

## Conclusion

The Related Prompts feature significantly enhances the user experience by providing intelligent content discovery. The multi-strategy approach ensures users always find relevant content, while the tabbed interface makes exploration intuitive and engaging.

The implementation is performant, scalable, and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive error handling. Future enhancements can build upon this solid foundation to create an even more powerful recommendation system.
